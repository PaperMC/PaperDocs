What is Paper?
--------------

Paper, and the PaperMC project behind it, exist to expand the platforms upon
which it is built. Paper has a relatively small team, despite that, we have
received a large amount of attention and a great showing of support from both
server administrators and fellow developers.

As such, we focus on a few things:

* A performant server is paramount.

* Giving back to the community matters.

* Mojang's decisions and assumptions are not necessarily the best for everyone.

Paper is largely composed of two projects:

* **Paper-API**, An enhanced version of the Bukkit API.

* **Paper-Server**, usually just referred to as *Paper*, Paper-Server is an
  enhanced implementation of the server that goes hand-in-hand with our
  enhanced API.

There are also other, more technical, projects that support the above two
projects. For more information on that see :doc:`./structure`.
