Introduction
============

Welcome to PaperDocs, the official documentation source for
the `PaperMC <https://www.github.com/PaperMC>`__ project.

Paper is a high performance fork of the Spigot Minecraft Server that aims to
fix gameplay and mechanics inconsistencies as well as to improve performance.

Paper contains numerous features, bug fixes, exploit preventions and major performance improvements not found in Spigot.

contains a short :doc:`about/introduction`, our :doc:`about/faq` and an article

Server owners should read our tips and instructions in :doc:`server/index` on
how to install, run and maintain a Paper based server.

The PaperMC project has several main components. Learn more about the project
structure :doc:`here <about/structure>`.
