Welcome to PaperDocs, the official documentation source for
the `PaperMC <https://www.github.com/PaperMC>`__ project.

Paper is a high performance fork of the Spigot Minecraft Server that aims to
fix gameplay and mechanics inconsistencies as well as to improve performance.

Paper contains numerous features, bug fixes, exploit preventions and
major performance improvements not found in Spigot.
