=========================================
Use a Personal Fork, not an Organization
=========================================

The Paper team will routinely modify your PR, whether it's a quick rebase or to take care of any minor nitpicks we might have. Often, it's better for us to solve these problems for you than make you go back and forth trying to fix it yourself.

Unfortunately, if you use an organization for your PR, it prevents the team from modifying it. This requires us to manually merge your PR, resulting in us closing the PR instead of marking it as merged.

We much prefer to have PRs show as merged, so please do not use repositories on organizations for PRs.

See https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1681 for more information on the issue.
