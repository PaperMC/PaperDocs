Pull Requests
=============

In order to add code to Paper or modify code already in Paper, you must submit a Pull Request via GitHub. We have a simple policy for new changes to Paper. Keep reading to find our Pull Request Policy, a tip for keeping your topic branches in sync, and some code change guidelines.

Policy
------

We'll accept changes that make sense. You should be able to justify their existence, along with any maintenance costs that come with them. Using :doc:`changes/obfuscation-helpers` aids in the maintenance costs. Remember that these changes will affect everyone who runs Paper, not just you and your server.

While we will fix minor formatting issues, you should stick to the guide below when making and submitting changes.
