What is Waterfall?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Waterfall is a fork of BungeeCord, a proxy used primarily to teleport players
between multiple Minecraft servers.

Waterfall focuses on three main areas:

- Stability: Waterfall aims to be stable. We will achieve this through making
  the code base testable and discouraging practices that lead to proxy lag.
- Features: Waterfall aims to include more features than canonical BungeeCord.
- Scalability: Waterfall should be able to handle a large number of concurrent
  players, given a reasonably modern CPU, memory, and good network connection.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Waterfall requires **Java 8** or newer to run. The Paper team recommends you run on Java 11 or higher.
Generally, LTS versions of Java are targeted, though you may have luck on newer versions.

Migrating From BungeeCord
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Waterfall is a drop in replacements for BungeeCord, you don't need to make any changes to your configuration.

Getting A Proxy Jar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Paper provides runnable proxy jars directly from our `website's downloads page <https://papermc.io/downloads#Waterfall>`_.

Click on the build number to download a file.

Running The Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the proxy, simply start it up like any other Java application.

Open your terminal, navigate to the saved location, and then run
``java -Xms512M -Xmx512M -jar waterfall-###.jar``

Aikar's recommended flags for Waterfall are as follows:
``java -Xms512M -Xmx512M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=4M -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions``
``-XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -jar waterfall-###.jar``

The amount of memory can be set by changing the numbers in the ``-Xms`` and ``-Xmx`` flags.

To configure your proxy, see the :doc:`../waterfall/configuration` page.

Updating The Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update the proxy, first stop it safely by executing the ``end`` command
and then replace the old proxy jar with a new one. That's it.
