=======================================

The installation steps for IntelliJ are more-or-less the same whether you use Windows, Mac, or Linux. Once IntelliJ is installed, you can move on to install the rest of your development toolset.

Direct Install Method
#####################

1. Navigate to the IntelliJ product page: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

    Notice that for Windows, the download should be an ``.exe``; for Mac, it should be a ``.dmg``; and for Linux, it should be a ``.tar.gz`` file.

    It is worth mentioning that for Linux, IntelliJ *may* be available via your package manager.

2. Download the Community edition for whichever OS you are using. For Windows, simply double-click and follow the installation prompt. For Mac, double-click the ``.dmg`` file to open it, and then drag the app inside to your ``Applications`` folder.
