=======================
Which IDE should I use?
=======================

It doesn't really matter. Pick one, and use one. It is preferable if the IDE has built-in `Maven`_ and `Gradle`_ support as these are prolific build tools in the space. 

`IntelliJ IDEA`_, `Eclipse`_, and `NetBeans`_ are all fine choices.

Our guides will be written with `IntelliJ IDEA`_ in mind, but instructions may be adapted by the user. Our chat group on Discord will be more than happy to help with any specific questions as well.
