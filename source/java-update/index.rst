===================
Updating to Java 16
===================

As of Minecraft 1.17, Paper will only support Java 16 and above. This is in line
with our new policy of only supporting the last two long-term-support (LTS)
versions of the Java runtime. Although Minecraft 1.17 requires a Java version
that is too new for any LTS, we will maintain our policy as far as possible. We
will only support Java 16 and above because of Mojang Studios deciding to bump
their own Java requirement with 1.17.

If you're a developer or want to be on the safe side, pick the JDK options in
the guides instead of a generic JRE. The JDK contains the JRE, in addition to
development material (sources, documentation, a reference compiler, and more).

To update, please find the appropriate header for you in the table of contents.

Shared hosts
============

If you cannot find your host in the following list, you should open a support
ticket with your host's website to ask how to update.

.. Bonus: You can PR a guide for the host you represent, or contact the Paper
   team if you'd like your guide in this list. Remember they must be in
   alphabetical order: we do not wish to order any hosts in any significant way.

Apex Hosting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apex Hosting is already on Java 16 for both Paper and Waterfall. You don't need
to do anything to update.

Aternos
~~~~~~~

If you run Paper, you should have Java 16 selected automatically. If you run
Minecraft 1.16 or earlier, you can change this in the server configuration panel
on their website to Java 8, 11, or 16:

.. image:: java-update-assets/aternos-environment.png

|br|

Bloom.Host
~~~~~~~~~~

You can select Java 16 from the server configuration panel by selecting the
Java version option ending in ``openjdk-16``:

|br|

Creeper.Host
~~~~~~~~~~~~

CreeperHost has some terrific documentation on how to do this on their website:
`Changing Java Version <https://wiki.creeper.host/books/minecraft-java-edition/page/changing-java-version>`_.

DedicatedMC
~~~~~~~~~~~

When loading Minecraft 1.17, the server will automatically be set to Java 16,
and you don't need to do anything whatsoever. If you wish to test Java 16 before
updating, you can set this yourself in the *Startup Settings* panel:

.. image:: java-update-assets/dedicatedmc-java-version.png

|br|

For more information, feel free to read the `How to change your server's Java
version <https://docs.dedicatedmc.io/server-setup/how-to-change-your-servers-java-version/>`_
guide on their wiki.

MCProHosting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When loading 1.17, the server will automatically be set to Java 16 and you don't
have to do anything whatsoever. If you want to test Java 16 on Minecraft 1.16 or
earlier, you will need to set the server type to *Snapshot*, then put Paper back
on the server manually.

Nitrado
~~~~~~~

If you create a 1.17 server the Java version will be set to Java 16 out of the box. However if it doesn't (because e.g. you upgraded the server manually) you can set the Java version under "General" -> "Java"

.. image:: java-update-assets/nitrado-settings-panel.png

PebbleHost
~~~~~~~~~~

PebbleHost's knowledgebase has a great article `Does PebbleHost support Java 16?
<https://help.pebblehost.com/en/article/does-pebblehost-support-java-11-java-16-1f5zlk2/>`_
on their website to show how to change the Java version, along with
incompatibilities with certain versions.

Server.pro
~~~~~~~~~~

Creating a server on 1.17 automatically selects Java 16.
To manually set the Java version, navigate to the control panel,
select ``Advanced Settings`` and select ``Java 16 - HotSpot``
on the dropdown menu. Save the changes by clicking ``Save Changes``
at the bottom of the page.

WinterNode
~~~~~~~~~~

WinterNode's Help Center has an helpful article `Java Version Selector
<https://www.notion.so/MC-1-17-Java-Version-Selection-c0ab39f51ab147de9b1125418e001fab>`_
showing how to change the Java version, along with recommendations per Minecraft
version. If you do nothing, it will automatically select the version that fits
best for your server.

Pterodactyl
===========

.. note::

    To switch the Java version on Pterodactyl, you will require an administrator
    account.

.. note::

    The names of options will be different depending on the language you use.

Assuming you are already logged in on your administrator account, open the
administrator control panel, go to the *Servers* tab, click on your server
(this has to be repeated for every server you wish to switch the Java version
of), and press the *Startup* tab.

Proceed by replacing the text in the *Image* input field under *Docker Container
Configuration* with the following: ``quay.io/parkervcp/pterodactyl-images:debian_openjdk-16``.
You can also replace ``16`` with ``11`` for Java 11.

.. image:: java-update-assets/pterodactyl-startup-tab.png

Debian/Ubuntu
=============

To install Java 16 on Debian, Ubuntu, and the plethora of other distributions
based on these, execute the following commands to add the AdoptOpenJDK APT repository and to install AdoptOpenJDK Hotspot:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install apt-transport-https software-properties-common gnupg wget
    $ wget -qO - https://adoptopenjdk.jfrog.io/adoptopenjdk/api/gpg/key/public | sudo apt-key add -
    $ sudo add-apt-repository https://adoptopenjdk.jfrog.io/adoptopenjdk/deb/
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install adoptopenjdk-16-hotspot
    
You can also replace ``16`` with ``11`` for Java 11.

RPM-Based
=========

To install Java 16 on CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, openSUSE, SLES and many other RPM-based
distributions, execute the following commands to add Amazon Corretto's
RPM repository and install Java 16.

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: DNF

    .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo rpm --import https://yum.corretto.aws/corretto.key
      $ sudo curl -Lo /etc/yum.repos.d/corretto.repo https://yum.corretto.aws/corretto.repo
      $ sudo dnf -y install java-16-amazon-corretto-devel

  .. tab:: zypper

    .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo zypper addrepo https://yum.corretto.aws/corretto.repo
      $ sudo zypper install java-16-amazon-corretto-devel

  .. tab:: yum

    .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo rpm --import https://yum.corretto.aws/corretto.key
      $ sudo curl -Lo /etc/yum.repos.d/corretto.repo https://yum.corretto.aws/corretto.repo
      $ sudo yum -y install java-16-amazon-corretto-devel

Arch Linux
==========

.. i use arch, btw

.. note::

    There is no JRE-only Java 16 package for Arch Linux. This is not an issue
    whatsoever, but if you'd like the smaller variant, you can use the `Linux
    (Generic)`_ guide instead.

To install Java 16 on Arch Linux, you will need to use the Arch User Repository
(AUR). You need to install the |jdk-adoptopenjdk AUR package|_.

.. |jdk-adoptopenjdk AUR package| replace:: ``jdk-adoptopenjdk`` package
.. _jdk-adoptopenjdk AUR package: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jdk-adoptopenjdk/

To simplify this process, and to make updating easier, see `yay
<https://github.com/Jguer/yay>`_.

To switch between available Java versions on the system, see the wiki on
`Switching between JVMs <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Java#Switching_between_JVM>`_.

Linux (Generic)
===============

.. note::

    You should check with your distribution's package manager(s) before using
    this section of the guide. It is very likely you can find a suitable Java
    version if you search its repositories for ``java``, ``openjdk``, and
    ``jre``.

SDKMAN!
~~~~~~~

Install SDKs with ease! Wa-pow! Luckily *SDKMAN!* is written in ``bash``, so you
can use this on practically any Linux (and BSD!) environment. Follow the
`installation instructions <https://sdkman.io/install>`_ on their website.

You can then proceed to install one of their many Java distributions with the
`simple commands on their website <https://sdkman.io/jdks>`_.

AdoptOpenJDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    This assumes an intermediate to advanced Linux user. Ask for help if you
    need it; we don't want you to harm your system. |#paper-help|_ is a fitting
    channel for asking, and remember: `don't ask to ask, just ask
    <https://dontasktoask.com/>`_.

.. note::

    You are going to require the ``tar`` and ``sha256sum`` tools to do this install.

First, select an appropriate ``tar.gz`` file from `AdoptOpenJDK's website
<https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot>`_,
and copy the download URL.

Next, figure out which directory you want to install Java to; this is commonly a
subdirectory within ``/usr/lib/jvm``. The tar file you copied the URL to has an
inner directory, so you don't need to create one yourself.

Download the file with one of the following commands:

* With ``curl``: ``curl -LJO "replace this text with the URL"``
* With ``wget``: ``wget "replace this text with the URL"``

And get the signature from pressing the ``Checksum (SHA256)`` button next to the
``.tar.gz`` download button. This should be the same as displayed in the second
column, output from running ``sha256sum "the downloaded file path goes here"``.
If they are not the same, delete the files and re-download them.

Next up, extract the file with: ``tar xzf "the downloaded file path goes
here"``. There should now be a directory named something like ``jdk-16.0.1+1/``.
You can safely delete the ``tar.gz`` file if this is the case.

Now you should add an environment variable called ``JAVA_HOME`` pointing to the
directory you created (e.g. ``/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-16.0.1+1``; note there is no
trailing slash here):

.. code-block:: console

    # cat <<EOF | tee /etc/profile.d/java.sh
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-16.0.1+1
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:"$PATH"
    EOF
    # chmod +x /etc/profile.d/java.sh

.. note::

    The ``#`` at the start means this has to be run as either ``root``, or an
    account that has access to the ``/etc/profile.d/`` directory. To avoid this,
    you can replace ``tee`` with ``sudo tee`` (or ``doas tee`` on BSD),
    and replace ``chmod`` with ``sudo chmod`` (or ``doas chmod`` on BSD).

You must now source the new file you created, which is usually done at the start
of a shell, so you can just re-open the shell. Alternatively, run ``source
/etc/profile.d/java.sh``.

Windows 10
==========

If you're on Windows 10, you will want AdoptOpenJDK's JRE. You can find the
``msi`` file you should install on `their website
<https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot>`_.

Remember to reboot your computer after installing.

Checking version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you now open a new PowerShell prompt and do ``java -version``, it should say
something along the lines of:

.. code-block::

    openjdk version "16.0.1" 2021-04-20
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK-16.0.1+9 (build 16.0.1+9)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK-16.0.1+9 (build 16.0.1+9, mixed mode, sharing)

It is the ``version "16.0.1"`` part that is important -- if the first number is
not ``16``, you need to modify your ``PATH``.

Modifying your ``PATH``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Press your Windows button and search (just start typing) ``environment
variable``. The ``Edit the system environment variables`` result is the one
you want.

.. image:: java-update-assets/windows-env-var-search.png

|br|

Press the ``Environment Variables...`` button:

.. image:: java-update-assets/windows-env-var-button.png

|br|

Select the ``JAVA_HOME`` variable in the ``System variables`` section in the
*bottom half* of the window and press ``Edit...``, OR
if the variable is not present, create a new variable with ``New...`` in the
*lower* half of the window, and name it ``JAVA_HOME``. You now want to ``Browse
Directory...`` and find the Java directory under ``C:\Program
Files\AdoptOpenJDK`` in the Windows Explorer window:

.. image:: java-update-assets/windows-browse-directory.png

|br|

Now go to your ``Path`` variable in the ``System variables`` section in the
*bottom half* of the window and press ``Edit...``.
If there is already a ``%JAVA_HOME%\bin`` entry in the list, skip this step.
Otherwise, press the ``New`` button at the top and enter ``%JAVA_HOME%\bin``:

.. image:: java-update-assets/windows-add-to-path.png

|br|

If you now open a new PowerShell window, you should have the correct output. If
not, restart your computer and try again. If it is still wrong, ask for help in
|#paper-help|_ to get further assistance.

macOS / OS X
============

If you're on macOS, you can use a tool called `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ to
install Java. Follow the `instructions on their website
<https://docs.brew.sh/Installation>`_ for how to install it.

To now install Java, open your Terminal app and run the following two commands:

.. code-block:: console

    $ brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
    $ brew install --cask adoptopenjdk16-jre

.. note::

    You can find the complete list of available Java versions on `the GitHub
    page of the Java tap
    <https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/homebrew-openjdk#available-versions>`_.
