What are system properties?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically system properties are used to denote aspects of the environment,
such as the operating system or system architecture. Individual applications
can also read custom system properties for their configuration. For paper,
system properties can be seen as an extension of paper.yml, things that have
been made configurable however are not fit for inclusion in paper.yml either
because they are only important to a small fraction of use cases such as
debugging, or could pose risk if misconfigured.

How do I set system properties?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While system properties can be modified at runtime, they are typically set
when you start the server. System properties can be set in your start command
. They follow the typical format of ``-Dkey=value``. If I wanted to set
``paper.example`` to ``true``, I would start my server like this: ``java
-Dpaper.example=true -jar paperclip.jar``. Note that properties are set
before -jar in your startup command.

Configurable System Properties Exposed by Paper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
    Remember - system properties are case sensitive. Paper unfortunately does
    not follow a standard case for properties.

Paper.IgnoreJavaVersion
=======================
Setting this to ``true`` will allow bypassing Spigot's java version
check. This will **not** allow your server to run on a lower than required
version of java. Default ``false``.

paper.ticklist-warn-on-excessive-delay
======================================
Weather to warn for excessive tick scheduling delay. Threshold set by
``paper.ticklist-excessive-delay-threshold``. Default ``false``.

paper.ticklist-excessive-delay-threshold
========================================
Specifies the excessive tick delay threshold on which to warn, set in
number of ticks. Has no effect without
``paper.ticklist-warn-on-excessive-delay``. Defaults ``60 * 20`` (60 seconds
in ticks).

paper.ticklist-max-tick-delay
=============================
Default ``-1``

timings.bypassMax
=================
Setting this to any value will allow you to bypass Paper's limit on timings
size. This will **not** however bypass limits set on the timings server. This
should only be used for debugging or when using an alternative timings server.

LetMeReload
===========
Setting this to true will let you reload the server without confirmation
. Default ``false`.

paper.disableChannelLimit
=========================
When set to true, this disables Spigot's channel limit. Enabling this may be
necessary in environments where Spigot's limit causes issues, such as servers
which encourage the use of large modpacks.

Paper.DisableClassPrioritization
================================
When set to true, this disables plugins' classloaders prioritizing their own
classes. Default ``false``.

Paper.debugDynamicMissingKeys
=============================
When set to true, prints additional details regarding missing NBT keys. When
dealing with large NBT objects, this can be computationally intensive.

disable.watchdog
================
When set to true, this prevents the watchdog from killing the server.

paper.explicit-flush
====================
When set to true, re-enables explicit network manager flushing.

Paper.enable-sync-chunk-writes
==============================
When set to true, allows the use of ``sync-chunk-writes`` in server
.properties.

paper.debug-sync-loads
======================
When set to true, allows the use of the ``/paper syncloadinfo`` function to
produce a log of sync chunk loads.

Paper.ignoreWorldDataVersion
============================
When set to true, this allows the server to load chunks generated by a newer
version of the game. Keep in mind that this will often lead to corruption.

Paper.allowAsyncChunksSingleCore
================================
When set to true, this allow asynchronous chunk IO with only one core.

debug.entities
==============
When set to true, this prints additional details for duplicate entities.

Paper.bypassHostCheck
=====================
When set to true, allows bypassing the bungeecord host check.
