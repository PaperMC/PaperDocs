The JVM Startup Flags to use – MC 1.15+ (Java 8+, MC 1.8+) Update
=================================================================

**Use these flags exactly, only changing Xmx and Xms. These flags work and scale accordingly to any size of memory, even 500MB but 1.15+ will not do well with such low memory…)**

.. code-block:: bash

   java -Xms10G -Xmx10G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 
   -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch 
   -XX:G1NewSizePercent=30 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=40 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=8M 
   -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:G1HeapWastePercent=5 -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=4 
   -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=15 -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=90 
   -XX:G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent=5 -XX:SurvivorRatio=32 -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem 
   -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1 -Dusing.aikars.flags=https://mcflags.emc.gs

LAST UPDATED: **Apr 25 2020 3:30PM EST**    

These flags are recommended for ALL versions of Minecraft! 1.8 all the way to 1.15+, use this set.

.. warning::
   **IMPORTANT – READ – Don’t use ALL of your memory!! PTERODACTYL USERS!**

   When setting the Xms and Xmx values, if your host says you have 8000M memory, DO NOT USE 8000M! Minecraft (and Java) needs additional memory on top of that Xmx parameter. 
   It is recommended to reduce your Xmx/Xms by about **1000-1500M** to avoid running out of memory or “OOMKiller” hitting your server. 
   This also leaves room for the Operating System to use memory too.
   **Have 8000M memory? Use 6500M for safety.** *But you may also ask your host if they will cover this overhead for you and give you 9500M instead. Some hosts will! Just ask.*

Recommended Memory
==================

**We recommend using at least 6-10GB**, no matter how few players! If you can’t afford 10GB of memory, give as much as you can, 
but ensure you leave the operating system some memory too. G1GC operates better with more memory.

If you are running with 12GB or less memory for MC, you should not adjust these parameters.

If you are using an Xmx value greater than 12G
==============================================

If you have and use more than 12GB of memory, adjust the following:

* -XX:G1NewSizePercent=40
* -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=50
* -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=16M
* -XX:G1ReservePercent=15
* -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=20

.. warning::
   If you see increase in old generation collections after this, revert back to the base flags!

Explanation of these changes:

* Base flag set aims for 30/40 to reduce risk of to space issues. With more memory, less of an issue. 
  We can give more to new generation with 40/50, as well as reduce reserve percent since the default reserve will already be larger.
* Region Size increase helps reduce humongous allocations, and speeds up remarking. We need a smaller region size at smaller heaps to ensure an adequate amount of regions available
* We can start looking for old generation memory to reclaim with more of a delay with IHOP at 20 since we have more old generation available to space on CPU.

Java GC Logging
===============

Are you having old gen issues with these flags? Add the following flags based on your java version to enable GC Logging:

**Java 8-10**

.. code-block:: bash

   -Xloggc:gc.log -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps 
   -XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation -XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=5 -XX:GCLogFileSize=1M

**Java 11+**

.. code-block:: bash

   -Xlog:gc*:logs/gc.log:time,uptime:filecount=5,filesize=1M

GC logging does not hurt your performance and can be left on at all times. The files will not take up much space (5MB)


Technical Explanation of the Flags
===================================

#. **-Xms matching -Xmx – Why:** You should never run your server with the case that -Xmx can run the system completely out of memory. 
   Your server should always be expected to use the entire -Xmx! You should then ensure the OS has extra memory on top of that Xmx for non MC/OS level things. 
   Therefore, you should never run MC with -Xmx settings you can’t support if java uses it all. Now, that means if -Xms is lower than -Xmx 
   **YOU HAVE UNUSED MEMORY! Unused memory is wasted memory.** G1 (and probably even CMS to a certain threshold, but we're only stating what we're sure about) 
   operates better with the more memory it’s given. G1 adaptively chooses how much memory to give to each region to optimize pause time. If you have more 
   memory than it needs to reach an optimal pause time, G1 will simply push that extra into the old generation and it will not hurt you 
   (This may not be the case for CMS, but is the case for G1). The fundamental idea of improving GC behavior is to ensure short lived objects die young and 
   never get promoted. With the more memory G1 has, the better assurance you will get that objects are not getting prematurely promoted to the old generation. 
   G1 Operates differently than previous collectors and is able to handle larger heaps more efficiently. 

   If it does not need the memory given to it, it will not use it. The entire engine operates differently and does not suffer from too large of heaps, 
   and this is industry wide accepted information that under G1 to keep Xms and Xmx the same!

#. **UnlockExperimentalVMOptions** – needed for some the below options

#. **G1NewSizePercent:** These are the important ones. In CMS and other Generations, tweaking the New Generation results in FIXED SIZE New Gen 
   and usually is done through explicit size setting with -Xmn.With G1, things are better! You now can specify percentages of an overall desired 
   range for the new generation. With these settings, we tell G1 to not use its default 5% for new gen, and instead give it 40%! **Minecraft has 
   an extremely high a memory allocation rate, ranging to at least 800 Megabytes a second on a 30 player server! And this is mostly short lived 
   objects (Block Position).** 

   Now, this means MC REALLY needs more focus on New Generation to be able to even support this allocation rate. If your new gen is too small, 
   you will be running new gen collections 1-2+ times per second, which is really bad. You will have so many pauses that TPS has risk of suffering, 
   and the server will not be able to keep up with the cost of GC’s. Then combine the fact that objects will now promote faster, resulting in your 
   Old Gen growing faster. Given more New Gen, we are able to slow down the intervals of Young Gen collections, resulting in more time for short 
   lived objects to die young and overall more efficient GC behavior.

#. **G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent:** Controls when to include regions in Mixed GC’s in the Young GC collection, keeping Old Gen tidy without 
   doing a normal Old Gen GC collection. When your memory is less than this percent, old gen won’t even be included in ‘mixed’ collections. 
   Mixed are not as heavy as a full old collection, so having small incremental cleanups of old keeps memory usage light. 
   
   Default is 65 to 85 depending on Java Version, we are setting to 90 to ensure we reclaim garbage in old gen as fast as possible 
   to retain as much free regions as we can. 

#. **G1ReservePercent=20:** MC Memory allocation rate in up to date versions is really insane. We run the risk of a dreaded 
   “to-space exhaustion” not having enough memory free to move data around. This ensures more memory is waiting to be used 
   for this operation. Default is 10, so we are giving another 10 to it.

#. **MaxTenuringThreshold=1:** Minecraft has a really high allocation rate of memory. Of that memory, most is reclaimed in 
   the eden generation. However transient data will overflow into survivor. Initially played with completely removing Survivor 
   and had decent results, but does result in transient data making its way to Old which is not good.Max Tenuring 1 ensures 
   that we do not promote transient data to old generation, but anything that survives 2 passes of Garbage Collection is just 
   going to be assumed as longer-lived.

   Doing this greatly reduces pause times in Young Collections as copying data up to 15 times in Survivor space for a tenured 
   object really takes a lot of time for actually old memory. Ideally the GC engine would track average age for objects instead 
   and tenure out data faster, but that is not how it works.

   Considering average GC rate is 10s to the upwards of minutes per young collection, this does not result in any ‘garbage’ 
   being promoted, and just delays longer lived memory to be collected in Mixed GC’s.

#. **SurvivorRatio=32:** Because we drastically reduced MaxTenuringThreshold, we will be reducing use of survivor space drastically. 
   This frees up more regions to be used by Eden instead.

#. **AlwaysPreTouch:** AlwaysPreTouch gets the memory setup and reserved at process start ensuring it is contiguous, improving 
   the efficiency of it more. This improves the operating systems memory access speed. Mandatory to use Transparent Huge Pages

#. **+DisableExplicitGC:** Many plugins think they know how to control memory, and try to invoke garbage collection. 
   Plugins that do this trigger a full garbage collection, triggering a massive lag spike. This flag disables plugins 
   from trying to do this, protecting you from their bad code.

#. **MaxGCPauseMillis=200:** This setting controls how much memory is used in between the Minimum and Maximum ranges 
   specified for your New Generation. This is a “goal” for how long you want your server to pause for collections. 
   200 is aiming for at most loss of 4 ticks. This will result in a short TPS drop, however the server can make up 
   for this drop instantly, meaning it will have no meaningful impact to your TPS. 200ms is lower than players can 
   recognize. In testing, having this value constrained to an even lower number results in G1 not recollecting memory 
   fast enough and potentially running out of old gen triggering a Full collection. Just because this number is 200 does 
   not mean every collection will be 200. It means it can use up to 200 if it really needs it, and we need to let it do 
   its job when there is memory to collect.

#. **+ParallelRefProcEnabled:** Optimizes the GC process to use multiple threads for weak reference checking. Not sure 
   why this isn’t default… 

#. **G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent=5:** Default is 10% of time spent during pause updating Rsets, reduce this to 5% 
   to make more of it concurrent to reduce pause durations.

#. **G1MixedGCCountTarget=4:** Default is 8. Because we are aiming to collect slower, with less old gen usage, 
   try to reclaim old gen memory faster to avoid running out of old.

#. **G1HeapRegionSize=8M+:** Default is auto calculated. SUPER important for Minecraft, especially 1.15, as 
   with low memory situations, the default calculation will in most times be too low. Any memory allocation half 
   of this size (4MB) will be treated as “Humongous” and promote straight to old generation and is harder to free. 
   If you allow java to use the default, you will be destroyed with a significant chunk of your memory getting treated as Humongous.

#. **+PerfDisableSharedMem:** Causes GC to write to file system which can cause major latency if disk IO is high

Using Large Pages
=================

Also for Large Pages – It’s even more important to use -Xms = -Xmx! Large Pages needs to have all of the memory specified 
for it or you could end up without the gains. This memory will not be used by the OS anyways, so use it.

Additionally use these flags (Metaspace is Java 8 Only, don’t use it for Java7): ``-XX:+UseLargePagesInMetaspace``


Transparent Huge Pages
======================

Controversial Feature but may be usable if you can not configure your host for real HugeTLBFS. 
Try adding ``-XX:+UseTransparentHugePages`` but it’s extremely important you also have AlwaysPreTouch set. 
Otherwise THP will likely hurt you. We have not measured how THP works for MC or its impact with AlwaysPreTouch, 
so this section is for the advanced users who want to experiement.
